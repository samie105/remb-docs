## Encapsulation[​](#encapsulation "Direct link to Encapsulation")

A fundamental feature of Fastify is the "encapsulation context." It governs which [decorators](/docs/latest/Reference/Decorators/), registered [hooks](/docs/latest/Reference/Hooks/), and [plugins](/docs/latest/Reference/Plugins/) are available to [routes](/docs/latest/Reference/Routes/). A visual representation of the encapsulation context is shown in the following figure:

![Figure 1](/assets/images/encapsulation_context-e6a156b803389fb785e6d0eab3b3b287.svg)

In the figure above, there are several entities:

1.  The _root context_
2.  Three _root plugins_
3.  Two _child contexts_, each with:
    *   Two _child plugins_
    *   One _grandchild context_, each with:
        *   Three _child plugins_

Every _child context_ and _grandchild context_ has access to the _root plugins_. Within each _child context_, the _grandchild contexts_ have access to the _child plugins_ registered within the containing _child context_, but the containing _child context_ **does not** have access to the _child plugins_ registered within its _grandchild context_.

Given that everything in Fastify is a [plugin](/docs/latest/Reference/Plugins/) except for the _root context_, every "context" and "plugin" in this example is a plugin that can consist of decorators, hooks, plugins, and routes. As plugins, they must still signal completion either by returning a Promise (e.g., using `async` functions) or by calling the `done` function if using the callback style.

To put this example into concrete terms, consider a basic scenario of a REST API server with three routes: the first route (`/one`) requires authentication, the second route (`/two`) does not, and the third route (`/three`) has access to the same context as the second route. Using [@fastify/bearer-auth](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-bearer-auth) to provide authentication, the code for this example is as follows:

```
'use strict'const fastify = require('fastify')()fastify.decorateRequest('answer', 42)fastify.register(async function authenticatedContext (childServer) {  childServer.register(require('@fastify/bearer-auth'), { keys: ['abc123'] })  childServer.route({    path: '/one',    method: 'GET',    handler (request, response) {      response.send({        answer: request.answer,        // request.foo will be undefined as it is only defined in publicContext        foo: request.foo,        // request.bar will be undefined as it is only defined in grandchildContext        bar: request.bar      })    }  })})fastify.register(async function publicContext (childServer) {  childServer.decorateRequest('foo', 'foo')  childServer.route({    path: '/two',    method: 'GET',    handler (request, response) {      response.send({        answer: request.answer,        foo: request.foo,        // request.bar will be undefined as it is only defined in grandchildContext        bar: request.bar      })    }  })  childServer.register(async function grandchildContext (grandchildServer) {    grandchildServer.decorateRequest('bar', 'bar')    grandchildServer.route({      path: '/three',      method: 'GET',      handler (request, response) {        response.send({          answer: request.answer,          foo: request.foo,          bar: request.bar        })      }    })  })})fastify.listen({ port: 8000 })
```

The server example above demonstrates the encapsulation concepts from the original diagram:

1.  Each _child context_ (`authenticatedContext`, `publicContext`, and `grandchildContext`) has access to the `answer` request decorator defined in the _root context_.
2.  Only the `authenticatedContext` has access to the `@fastify/bearer-auth` plugin.
3.  Both the `publicContext` and `grandchildContext` have access to the `foo` request decorator.
4.  Only the `grandchildContext` has access to the `bar` request decorator.

To see this, start the server and issue requests:

```
# curl -H 'authorization: Bearer abc123' http://127.0.0.1:8000/one{"answer":42}# curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/two{"answer":42,"foo":"foo"}# curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/three{"answer":42,"foo":"foo","bar":"bar"}
```

## Sharing Between Contexts[​](#sharing-between-contexts "Direct link to Sharing Between Contexts")

Each context in the prior example inherits _only_ from its parent contexts. Parent contexts cannot access entities within their descendant contexts. If needed, encapsulation can be broken using [fastify-plugin](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-plugin), making anything registered in a descendant context available to the parent context.

To allow `publicContext` access to the `bar` decorator in `grandchildContext`, rewrite the code as follows:

```
'use strict'const fastify = require('fastify')()const fastifyPlugin = require('fastify-plugin')fastify.decorateRequest('answer', 42)// `authenticatedContext` omitted for clarityfastify.register(async function publicContext (childServer) {  childServer.decorateRequest('foo', 'foo')  childServer.route({    path: '/two',    method: 'GET',    handler (request, response) {      response.send({        answer: request.answer,        foo: request.foo,        bar: request.bar      })    }  })  childServer.register(fastifyPlugin(grandchildContext))  async function grandchildContext (grandchildServer) {    grandchildServer.decorateRequest('bar', 'bar')    grandchildServer.route({      path: '/three',      method: 'GET',      handler (request, response) {        response.send({          answer: request.answer,          foo: request.foo,          bar: request.bar        })      }    })  }})fastify.listen({ port: 8000 })
```

Restarting the server and re-issuing the requests for `/two` and `/three`:

```
# curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/two{"answer":42,"foo":"foo","bar":"bar"}# curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/three{"answer":42,"foo":"foo","bar":"bar"}
```
