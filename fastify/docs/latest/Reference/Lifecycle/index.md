## Lifecycle[​](#lifecycle "Direct link to Lifecycle")

This schema shows the internal lifecycle of Fastify.

The right branch of each section shows the next phase of the lifecycle. The left branch shows the corresponding error code generated if the parent throws an error. All errors are automatically handled by Fastify.

```

When `handlerTimeout` is configured, a timer starts after routing. If the response is not sent within the allowed time, `request.signal` is aborted and a 503 error is sent. The timer is cleared when the response finishes or when `reply.hijack()` is called. See [`handlerTimeout`](/docs/latest/Reference/Server/#factory-handler-timeout).

Before or during the `User Handler`, `reply.hijack()` can be called to:

*   Prevent Fastify from running subsequent hooks and the user handler
*   Prevent Fastify from sending the response automatically

If `reply.raw` is used to send a response, `onResponse` hooks will still be executed.

## Reply Lifecycle[​](#reply-lifecycle "Direct link to Reply Lifecycle")

When the user handles the request, the result may be:

*   In an async handler: it returns a payload or throws an `Error`
*   In a sync handler: it sends a payload or an `Error` instance

If the reply was hijacked, all subsequent steps are skipped. Otherwise, when submitted, the data flow is as follows:

```

`reply sent` means the JSON payload will be serialized by one of the following:

*   The [reply serializer](/docs/latest/Reference/Server/#setreplyserializer) if set
*   The [serializer compiler](/docs/latest/Reference/Server/#setserializercompiler) if a JSON schema is set for the HTTP status code
*   The default `JSON.stringify` function

## Shutdown Lifecycle[​](#shutdown-lifecycle "Direct link to Shutdown Lifecycle")

When [`fastify.close()`](/docs/latest/Reference/Server/#close) is called, the server goes through a graceful shutdown sequence involving [`preClose`](/docs/latest/Reference/Hooks/#pre-close) hooks, connection draining, and [`onClose`](/docs/latest/Reference/Hooks/#on-close) hooks. See the [`close`](/docs/latest/Reference/Server/#close) method documentation for the full step-by-step lifecycle.
