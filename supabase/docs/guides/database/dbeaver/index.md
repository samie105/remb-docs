Connecting with DBeaver

If you do not have DBeaver, you can download it from its [website](https://dbeaver.io/download/).

3

### Get Your Credentials

On your project dashboard, click [Connect](/dashboard/project/_?showConnect=true), note your session pooler's:

*   host
*   username

You will also need your database's password. If you forgot it, you can generate a new one in the settings.

If you're in an [IPv6 environment](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/27034) or have the IPv4 Add-On, you can use the direct connection string instead of Supavisor in Session mode.
