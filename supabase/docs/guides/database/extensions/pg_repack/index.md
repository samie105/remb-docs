pg\_repack: Physical storage optimization and maintenance

* * *

[pg\_repack](https://github.com/reorg/pg_repack) is a Postgres extension to remove bloat from tables and indexes, and optionally restore the physical order of clustered indexes. Unlike CLUSTER and VACUUM FULL, pg\_repack runs "online" and does not hold a exclusive locks on the processed tables that could prevent ongoing database operations. pg\_repack's efficiency is comparable to using CLUSTER directly.

pg\_repack provides the following methods to optimize physical storage:

*   Online CLUSTER: ordering table data by cluster index in a non-blocking way
*   Ordering table data by specified columns
*   Online VACUUM FULL: packing rows only in a non-blocking way
*   Rebuild or relocate only the indexes of a table

pg\_repack has 2 components, the database extension and a client-side CLI to control it.

## Requirements[#](#requirements)

*   A target table must have a PRIMARY KEY, or a UNIQUE total index on a NOT NULL column.
*   Performing a full-table repack requires free disk space about twice as large as the target table and its indexes.

pg\_repack requires the Postgres superuser role by default. That role is not available to users on the Supabase platform. To avoid that requirement, use the `-k` or `--no-superuser-check` flags on every `pg_repack` CLI command.

The first version of pg\_repack with full support for non-superuser repacking is 1.5.2. You can check the version installed on your Supabase instance using

```
1select default_version2from pg_available_extensions3where name = 'pg_repack';
```

If pg\_repack is not present, or the version is < 1.5.2, [upgrade to the latest version](/docs/guides/platform/upgrading) of Supabase to gain access.

## Usage[#](#usage)

### Enable the extension[#](#enable-the-extension)

Get started with pg\_repack by enabling the extension in the Supabase Dashboard.

1.  Go to the [Database](/dashboard/project/_/database/tables) page in the Dashboard.
2.  Click on **Extensions** in the sidebar.
3.  Search for "pg\_repack" and enable the extension.

### Install the CLI[#](#install-the-cli)

Select an option from the pg\_repack docs to [install the client CLI](https://reorg.github.io/pg_repack/#download).

### Syntax[#](#syntax)

All pg\_repack commands should include the `-k` flag to skip the client-side superuser check.

```
1pg_repack -k [OPTION]... [DBNAME]
```

## Example[#](#example)

Perform an online `VACUUM FULL` on the tables `public.foo` and `public.bar` in the database `postgres`:

```
1pg_repack -k -h db.<PROJECT_REF>.supabase.co -p 5432 -U postgres -d postgres --no-order --table public.foo --table public.bar
```

See the [official pg\_repack documentation](https://reorg.github.io/pg_repack/) for the full list of options.

## Limitations[#](#limitations)

*   pg\_repack cannot reorganize temporary tables.
*   pg\_repack cannot cluster tables by GiST indexes.
*   You cannot perform DDL commands of the target tables except VACUUM or ANALYZE while pg\_repack is working. pg\_repack holds an ACCESS SHARE lock on the target table to enforce this restriction.
