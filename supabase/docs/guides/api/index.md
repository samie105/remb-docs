Data REST API

* * *

Supabase auto-generates an API directly from your database schema allowing you to connect to your database through a restful interface, directly from the browser.

The API is auto-generated from your database and is designed to get you building as fast as possible, without writing a single line of code.

You can use them directly from the browser (two-tier architecture), or as a complement to your own API server (three-tier architecture).

## Features [#](#rest-api-overview)

Supabase provides a RESTful API using [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org/). This is a very thin API layer on top of Postgres. It exposes everything you need from a CRUD API at the URL `https://<project_ref>.supabase.co/rest/v1/`.

The REST interface is automatically reflected from your database's schema and is:

*   **Instant and auto-generated.**  
    As you update your database the changes are immediately accessible through your API.
*   **Self documenting.**  
    Supabase generates documentation in the Dashboard which updates as you make database changes.
*   **Secure.**  
    The API is configured to work with Postgres's Row Level Security, provisioned behind an API gateway with key-auth enabled.
*   **Fast.**  
    Our benchmarks for basic reads are more than 300% faster than Firebase. The API is a very thin layer on top of Postgres, which does most of the heavy lifting.
*   **Scalable.**  
    The API can serve thousands of simultaneous requests, and works well for Serverless workloads.

The reflected API is designed to retain as much of Postgres' capability as possible including:

*   Basic CRUD operations (Create/Read/Update/Delete)
*   Arbitrarily deep relationships among tables/views, functions that return table types can also nest related tables/views.
*   Works with Postgres Views, Materialized Views and Foreign Tables
*   Works with Postgres Functions
*   User defined computed columns and computed relationships
*   The Postgres security model - including Row Level Security, Roles, and Grants.

The REST API resolves all requests to a single SQL statement leading to fast response times and high throughput.
