Supabase Auth provides these [general configuration options](/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers) to control user access to your application:

*   **Allow new users to sign up**: Users will be able to sign up. If this config is disabled, only existing users can sign in.
    
*   **Confirm Email**: Users will need to confirm their email address before signing in for the first time.
    
    *   Having **Confirm Email** disabled assumes that the user's email does not need to be verified in order to login and implicitly confirms the user's email in the database.
    *   This option can be found in the email provider under the provider-specific configuration.
*   **Allow anonymous sign-ins**: Allow anonymous users to be created.
    
*   **Allow manual linking**: Allow users to link their accounts manually.
