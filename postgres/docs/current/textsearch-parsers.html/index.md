Text search parsers are responsible for splitting raw document text into _tokens_ and identifying each token's type, where the set of possible types is defined by the parser itself. Note that a parser does not modify the text at all — it simply identifies plausible word boundaries. Because of this limited scope, there is less need for application-specific custom parsers than there is for custom dictionaries. At present PostgreSQL provides just one built-in parser, which has been found to be useful for a wide range of applications.

The built-in parser is named `pg_catalog.default`. It recognizes 23 token types, shown in [Table 12.1](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch-parsers.html#TEXTSEARCH-DEFAULT-PARSER "Table 12.1. Default Parser's Token Types").

### Note

The parser's notion of a “letter” is determined by the database's locale setting, specifically `lc_ctype`. Words containing only the basic ASCII letters are reported as a separate token type, since it is sometimes useful to distinguish them. In most European languages, token types `word` and `asciiword` should be treated alike.

`email` does not support all valid email characters as defined by [RFC 5322](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5322). Specifically, the only non-alphanumeric characters supported for email user names are period, dash, and underscore.

`tag` does not support all valid tag names as defined by [W3C Recommendation, XML](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/). Specifically, the only tag names supported are those starting with an ASCII letter, underscore, or colon, and containing only letters, digits, hyphens, underscores, periods, and colons. `tag` also includes XML comments starting with `<!--` and ending with `-->`, and XML declarations (but note that this includes anything starting with `<?x` and ending with `>`).

It is possible for the parser to produce overlapping tokens from the same piece of text. As an example, a hyphenated word will be reported both as the entire word and as each component:

SELECT alias, description, token FROM ts\_debug('foo-bar-beta1');
      alias      |               description                |     token
-----------------+------------------------------------------+---------------
 numhword        | Hyphenated word, letters and digits      | foo-bar-beta1
 hword\_asciipart | Hyphenated word part, all ASCII          | foo
 blank           | Space symbols                            | -
 hword\_asciipart | Hyphenated word part, all ASCII          | bar
 blank           | Space symbols                            | -
 hword\_numpart   | Hyphenated word part, letters and digits | beta1

This behavior is desirable since it allows searches to work for both the whole compound word and for components. Here is another instructive example:

SELECT alias, description, token FROM ts\_debug('http://example.com/stuff/index.html');
  alias   |  description  |            token
----------+---------------+------------------------------
 protocol | Protocol head | http://
 url      | URL           | example.com/stuff/index.html
 host     | Host          | example.com
 url\_path | URL path      | /stuff/index.html
