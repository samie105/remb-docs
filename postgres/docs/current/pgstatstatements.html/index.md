The `pg_stat_statements` module provides a means for tracking planning and execution statistics of all SQL statements executed by a server.

The module must be loaded by adding `pg_stat_statements` to [shared\_preload\_libraries](../runtime-config-client.html/index.md#GUC-SHARED-PRELOAD-LIBRARIES) in `postgresql.conf`, because it requires additional shared memory. This means that a server restart is needed to add or remove the module. In addition, query identifier calculation must be enabled in order for the module to be active, which is done automatically if [compute\_query\_id](../runtime-config-statistics.html/index.md#GUC-COMPUTE-QUERY-ID) is set to `auto` or `on`, or any third-party module that calculates query identifiers is loaded.

When `pg_stat_statements` is active, it tracks statistics across all databases of the server. To access and manipulate these statistics, the module provides views `pg_stat_statements` and `pg_stat_statements_info`, and the utility functions `pg_stat_statements_reset` and `pg_stat_statements`. These are not available globally but can be enabled for a specific database with `CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements`.

### F.32.1. The `pg_stat_statements` View [#](#PGSTATSTATEMENTS-PG-STAT-STATEMENTS)

The statistics gathered by the module are made available via a view named `pg_stat_statements`. This view contains one row for each distinct combination of database ID, user ID, query ID and whether it's a top-level statement or not (up to the maximum number of distinct statements that the module can track). The columns of the view are shown in [Table F.22](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgstatstatements.html#PGSTATSTATEMENTS-COLUMNS "Table F.22. pg_stat_statements Columns").

For security reasons, only superusers and roles with privileges of the `pg_read_all_stats` role are allowed to see the SQL text and `queryid` of queries executed by other users. Other users can see the statistics, however, if the view has been installed in their database.

Plannable queries (that is, `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `MERGE`) and utility commands are combined into a single `pg_stat_statements` entry whenever they have identical query structures according to an internal hash calculation. Typically, two queries will be considered the same for this purpose if they are semantically equivalent except for the values of literal constants appearing in the query.

### Note

The following details about constant replacement and `queryid` only apply when [compute\_query\_id](../runtime-config-statistics.html/index.md#GUC-COMPUTE-QUERY-ID) is enabled. If you use an external module instead to compute `queryid`, you should refer to its documentation for details.

When a constant's value has been ignored for purposes of matching the query to other queries, the constant is replaced by a parameter symbol, such as `$1`, in the `pg_stat_statements` display. The rest of the query text is that of the first query that had the particular `queryid` hash value associated with the `pg_stat_statements` entry.

Queries on which normalization can be applied may be observed with constant values in `pg_stat_statements`, especially when there is a high rate of entry deallocations. To reduce the likelihood of this happening, consider increasing `pg_stat_statements.max`. The `pg_stat_statements_info` view, discussed below in [Section F.32.2](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgstatstatements.html#PGSTATSTATEMENTS-PG-STAT-STATEMENTS-INFO "F.32.2. The pg_stat_statements_info View"), provides statistics about entry deallocations.

In some cases, queries with visibly different texts might get merged into a single `pg_stat_statements` entry; as explained above, this is expected to happen for semantically equivalent queries. In addition, if the only difference between queries is the number of elements in a list of constants, the list will get squashed down to a single element but shown with a commented-out list indicator:

\=# SELECT pg\_stat\_statements\_reset();
=# SELECT \* FROM test WHERE a IN (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7);
=# SELECT \* FROM test WHERE a IN (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8);
=# SELECT query, calls FROM pg\_stat\_statements
   WHERE query LIKE 'SELECT%';
-\[ RECORD 1 \]------------------------------
query | SELECT \* FROM test WHERE a IN ($1 /\*, ... \*/)
calls | 2

In addition to these cases, there is a small chance of hash collisions causing unrelated queries to be merged into one entry. (This cannot happen for queries belonging to different users or databases, however.)

Since the `queryid` hash value is computed on the post-parse-analysis representation of the queries, the opposite is also possible: queries with identical texts might appear as separate entries, if they have different meanings as a result of factors such as different `search_path` settings.

Consumers of `pg_stat_statements` may wish to use `queryid` (perhaps in combination with `dbid` and `userid`) as a more stable and reliable identifier for each entry than its query text. However, it is important to understand that there are only limited guarantees around the stability of the `queryid` hash value. Since the identifier is derived from the post-parse-analysis tree, its value is a function of, among other things, the internal object identifiers appearing in this representation. This has some counterintuitive implications. For example, `pg_stat_statements` will consider two apparently-identical queries to be distinct, if they reference for example a function that was dropped and recreated between the executions of the two queries. Conversely, if a table is dropped and recreated between the executions of queries, two apparently-identical queries may be considered the same. However, if the alias for a table is different for otherwise-similar queries, these queries will be considered distinct. The hashing process is also sensitive to differences in machine architecture and other facets of the platform. Furthermore, it is not safe to assume that `queryid` will be stable across major versions of PostgreSQL.

Two servers participating in replication based on physical WAL replay can be expected to have identical `queryid` values for the same query. However, logical replication schemes do not promise to keep replicas identical in all relevant details, so `queryid` will not be a useful identifier for accumulating costs across a set of logical replicas. If in doubt, direct testing is recommended.

Generally, it can be assumed that `queryid` values are stable between minor version releases of PostgreSQL, providing that instances are running on the same machine architecture and the catalog metadata details match. Compatibility will only be broken between minor versions as a last resort.

The parameter symbols used to replace constants in representative query texts start from the next number after the highest `$`_`n`_ parameter in the original query text, or `$1` if there was none. It's worth noting that in some cases there may be hidden parameter symbols that affect this numbering. For example, PL/pgSQL uses hidden parameter symbols to insert values of function local variables into queries, so that a PL/pgSQL statement like `SELECT i + 1 INTO j` would have representative text like `SELECT i + $2`.

The representative query texts are kept in an external disk file, and do not consume shared memory. Therefore, even very lengthy query texts can be stored successfully. However, if many long query texts are accumulated, the external file might grow unmanageably large. As a recovery method if that happens, `pg_stat_statements` may choose to discard the query texts, whereupon all existing entries in the `pg_stat_statements` view will show null `query` fields, though the statistics associated with each `queryid` are preserved. If this happens, consider reducing `pg_stat_statements.max` to prevent recurrences.

`plans` and `calls` aren't always expected to match because planning and execution statistics are updated at their respective end phase, and only for successful operations. For example, if a statement is successfully planned but fails during the execution phase, only its planning statistics will be updated. If planning is skipped because a cached plan is used, only its execution statistics will be updated.

### F.32.2. The `pg_stat_statements_info` View [#](#PGSTATSTATEMENTS-PG-STAT-STATEMENTS-INFO)

The statistics of the `pg_stat_statements` module itself are tracked and made available via a view named `pg_stat_statements_info`. This view contains only a single row. The columns of the view are shown in [Table F.23](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgstatstatements.html#PGSTATSTATEMENTSINFO-COLUMNS "Table F.23. pg_stat_statements_info Columns").

**Table F.23. `pg_stat_statements_info` Columns**

| 
Column Type

Description

 |
| --- |
| 

`dealloc` `bigint`

Total number of times `pg_stat_statements` entries about the least-executed statements were deallocated because more distinct statements than `pg_stat_statements.max` were observed

 |
| 

`stats_reset` `timestamp with time zone`

Time at which all statistics in the `pg_stat_statements` view were last reset.

 |

  

### F.32.3. Functions [#](#PGSTATSTATEMENTS-FUNCS)

`pg_stat_statements_reset(userid Oid, dbid Oid, queryid bigint, minmax_only boolean) returns timestamp with time zone`

`pg_stat_statements_reset` discards statistics gathered so far by `pg_stat_statements` corresponding to the specified `userid`, `dbid` and `queryid`. If any of the parameters are not specified, the default value `0`(invalid) is used for each of them and the statistics that match with other parameters will be reset. If no parameter is specified or all the specified parameters are `0`(invalid), it will discard all statistics. If all statistics in the `pg_stat_statements` view are discarded, it will also reset the statistics in the `pg_stat_statements_info` view. When `minmax_only` is `true` only the values of minimum and maximum planning and execution time will be reset (i.e. `min_plan_time`, `max_plan_time`, `min_exec_time` and `max_exec_time` fields). The default value for `minmax_only` parameter is `false`. Time of last min/max reset performed is shown in `minmax_stats_since` field of the `pg_stat_statements` view. This function returns the time of a reset. This time is saved to `stats_reset` field of `pg_stat_statements_info` view or to `minmax_stats_since` field of the `pg_stat_statements` view if the corresponding reset was actually performed. By default, this function can only be executed by superusers. Access may be granted to others using `GRANT`.

`pg_stat_statements(showtext boolean) returns setof record`

The `pg_stat_statements` view is defined in terms of a function also named `pg_stat_statements`. It is possible for clients to call the `pg_stat_statements` function directly, and by specifying `showtext := false` have query text be omitted (that is, the `OUT` argument that corresponds to the view's `query` column will return nulls). This feature is intended to support external tools that might wish to avoid the overhead of repeatedly retrieving query texts of indeterminate length. Such tools can instead cache the first query text observed for each entry themselves, since that is all `pg_stat_statements` itself does, and then retrieve query texts only as needed. Since the server stores query texts in a file, this approach may reduce physical I/O for repeated examination of the `pg_stat_statements` data.

### F.32.4. Configuration Parameters [#](#PGSTATSTATEMENTS-CONFIG-PARAMS)

`pg_stat_statements.max` (`integer`)

`pg_stat_statements.max` is the maximum number of statements tracked by the module (i.e., the maximum number of rows in the `pg_stat_statements` view). If more distinct statements than that are observed, information about the least-executed statements is discarded. The number of times such information was discarded can be seen in the `pg_stat_statements_info` view. The default value is 5000. This parameter can only be set at server start.

`pg_stat_statements.track` (`enum`)

`pg_stat_statements.track` controls which statements are counted by the module. Specify `top` to track top-level statements (those issued directly by clients), `all` to also track nested statements (such as statements invoked within functions), or `none` to disable statement statistics collection. The default value is `top`. Only superusers can change this setting.

`pg_stat_statements.track_utility` (`boolean`)

`pg_stat_statements.track_utility` controls whether utility commands are tracked by the module. Utility commands are all those other than `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `MERGE`. The default value is `on`. Only superusers can change this setting.

`pg_stat_statements.track_planning` (`boolean`)

`pg_stat_statements.track_planning` controls whether planning operations and duration are tracked by the module. Enabling this parameter may incur a noticeable performance penalty, especially when statements with identical query structure are executed by many concurrent connections which compete to update a small number of `pg_stat_statements` entries. The default value is `off`. Only superusers can change this setting.

`pg_stat_statements.save` (`boolean`)

`pg_stat_statements.save` specifies whether to save statement statistics across server shutdowns. If it is `off` then statistics are not saved at shutdown nor reloaded at server start. The default value is `on`. This parameter can only be set in the `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line.

The module requires additional shared memory proportional to `pg_stat_statements.max`. Note that this memory is consumed whenever the module is loaded, even if `pg_stat_statements.track` is set to `none`.

These parameters must be set in `postgresql.conf`. Typical usage might be:

\# postgresql.conf
shared\_preload\_libraries = 'pg\_stat\_statements'

compute\_query\_id = on
pg\_stat\_statements.max = 10000
pg\_stat\_statements.track = all
