### 19.6.3. Standby Servers [#](#RUNTIME-CONFIG-REPLICATION-STANDBY)

These settings control the behavior of a [standby server](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/warm-standby.html#STANDBY-SERVER-OPERATION "26.2.2. Standby Server Operation") that is to receive replication data. Their values on the primary server are irrelevant.

`primary_conninfo` (`string`) [#](#GUC-PRIMARY-CONNINFO)

Specifies a connection string to be used for the standby server to connect with a sending server. This string is in the format described in [Section 32.1.1](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING "32.1.1. Connection Strings"). If any option is unspecified in this string, then the corresponding environment variable (see [Section 32.15](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-envars.html "32.15. Environment Variables")) is checked. If the environment variable is not set either, then defaults are used.

The connection string should specify the host name (or address) of the sending server, as well as the port number if it is not the same as the standby server's default. Also specify a user name corresponding to a suitably-privileged role on the sending server (see [Section 26.2.5.1](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/warm-standby.html#STREAMING-REPLICATION-AUTHENTICATION "26.2.5.1. Authentication")). A password needs to be provided too, if the sender demands password authentication. It can be provided in the `primary_conninfo` string, or in a separate `~/.pgpass` file on the standby server (use `replication` as the database name).

For replication slot synchronization (see [Section 47.2.3](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logicaldecoding-explanation.html#LOGICALDECODING-REPLICATION-SLOTS-SYNCHRONIZATION "47.2.3. Replication Slot Synchronization")), it is also necessary to specify a valid `dbname` in the `primary_conninfo` string. This will only be used for slot synchronization. It is ignored for streaming.

This parameter can only be set in the `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line. If this parameter is changed while the WAL receiver process is running, that process is signaled to shut down and expected to restart with the new setting (except if `primary_conninfo` is an empty string). This setting has no effect if the server is not in standby mode.

`primary_slot_name` (`string`) [#](#GUC-PRIMARY-SLOT-NAME)

Optionally specifies an existing replication slot to be used when connecting to the sending server via streaming replication to control resource removal on the upstream node (see [Section 26.2.6](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/warm-standby.html#STREAMING-REPLICATION-SLOTS "26.2.6. Replication Slots")). This parameter can only be set in the `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line. If this parameter is changed while the WAL receiver process is running, that process is signaled to shut down and expected to restart with the new setting. This setting has no effect if `primary_conninfo` is not set or the server is not in standby mode.

`hot_standby` (`boolean`) [#](#GUC-HOT-STANDBY)

Specifies whether or not you can connect and run queries during recovery, as described in [Section 26.4](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/hot-standby.html "26.4. Hot Standby"). The default value is `on`. This parameter can only be set at server start. It only has effect during archive recovery or in standby mode.

`max_standby_archive_delay` (`integer`) [#](#GUC-MAX-STANDBY-ARCHIVE-DELAY)

When hot standby is active, this parameter determines how long the standby server should wait before canceling standby queries that conflict with about-to-be-applied WAL entries, as described in [Section 26.4.2](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/hot-standby.html#HOT-STANDBY-CONFLICT "26.4.2. Handling Query Conflicts"). `max_standby_archive_delay` applies when WAL data is being read from WAL archive (and is therefore not current). If this value is specified without units, it is taken as milliseconds. The default is 30 seconds. A value of -1 allows the standby to wait forever for conflicting queries to complete. This parameter can only be set in the `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line.

Note that `max_standby_archive_delay` is not the same as the maximum length of time a query can run before cancellation; rather it is the maximum total time allowed to apply any one WAL segment's data. Thus, if one query has resulted in significant delay earlier in the WAL segment, subsequent conflicting queries will have much less grace time.

`max_standby_streaming_delay` (`integer`) [#](#GUC-MAX-STANDBY-STREAMING-DELAY)

When hot standby is active, this parameter determines how long the standby server should wait before canceling standby queries that conflict with about-to-be-applied WAL entries, as described in [Section 26.4.2](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/hot-standby.html#HOT-STANDBY-CONFLICT "26.4.2. Handling Query Conflicts"). `max_standby_streaming_delay` applies when WAL data is being received via streaming replication. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as milliseconds. The default is 30 seconds. A value of -1 allows the standby to wait forever for conflicting queries to complete. This parameter can only be set in the `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line.

Note that `max_standby_streaming_delay` is not the same as the maximum length of time a query can run before cancellation; rather it is the maximum total time allowed to apply WAL data once it has been received from the primary server. Thus, if one query has resulted in significant delay, subsequent conflicting queries will have much less grace time until the standby server has caught up again.

`wal_receiver_create_temp_slot` (`boolean`) [#](#GUC-WAL-RECEIVER-CREATE-TEMP-SLOT)

Specifies whether the WAL receiver process should create a temporary replication slot on the remote instance when no permanent replication slot to use has been configured (using [primary\_slot\_name](postgres/docs/current/runtime-config-replication.html/index.md#GUC-PRIMARY-SLOT-NAME)). The default is off. This parameter can only be set in the `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line. If this parameter is changed while the WAL receiver process is running, that process is signaled to shut down and expected to restart with the new setting.

`wal_receiver_status_interval` (`integer`) [#](#GUC-WAL-RECEIVER-STATUS-INTERVAL)

Specifies the minimum frequency for the WAL receiver process on the standby to send information about replication progress to the primary or upstream standby, where it can be seen using the [`pg_stat_replication`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/monitoring-stats.html#MONITORING-PG-STAT-REPLICATION-VIEW "27.2.4. pg_stat_replication") view. The standby will report the last write-ahead log location it has written, the last position it has flushed to disk, and the last position it has applied. This parameter's value is the maximum amount of time between reports. Updates are sent each time the write or flush positions change, or as often as specified by this parameter if set to a non-zero value. There are additional cases where updates are sent while ignoring this parameter; for example, when processing of the existing WAL completes or when `synchronous_commit` is set to `remote_apply`. Thus, the apply position may lag slightly behind the true position. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as seconds. The default value is 10 seconds. This parameter can only be set in the `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line.

`hot_standby_feedback` (`boolean`) [#](#GUC-HOT-STANDBY-FEEDBACK)

Specifies whether or not a hot standby will send feedback to the primary or upstream standby about queries currently executing on the standby. This parameter can be used to eliminate query cancels caused by cleanup records, but can cause database bloat on the primary for some workloads. Feedback messages will not be sent more frequently than once per `wal_receiver_status_interval`. The default value is `off`. This parameter can only be set in the `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line.

If cascaded replication is in use the feedback is passed upstream until it eventually reaches the primary. Standbys make no other use of feedback they receive other than to pass upstream.

Note that if the clock on standby is moved ahead or backward, the feedback message might not be sent at the required interval. In extreme cases, this can lead to a prolonged risk of not removing dead rows on the primary for extended periods, as the feedback mechanism is based on timestamps.

`wal_receiver_timeout` (`integer`) [#](#GUC-WAL-RECEIVER-TIMEOUT)

Terminate replication connections that are inactive for longer than this amount of time. This is useful for the receiving standby server to detect a primary node crash or network outage. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as milliseconds. The default value is 60 seconds. A value of zero disables the timeout mechanism. This parameter can only be set in the `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line.

`wal_retrieve_retry_interval` (`integer`) [#](#GUC-WAL-RETRIEVE-RETRY-INTERVAL)

Specifies how long the standby server should wait when WAL data is not available from any sources (streaming replication, local `pg_wal` or WAL archive) before trying again to retrieve WAL data. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as milliseconds. The default value is 5 seconds. This parameter can only be set in the `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line.

This parameter is useful in configurations where a node in recovery needs to control the amount of time to wait for new WAL data to be available. For example, in archive recovery, it is possible to make the recovery more responsive in the detection of a new WAL file by reducing the value of this parameter. On a system with low WAL activity, increasing it reduces the amount of requests necessary to access WAL archives, something useful for example in cloud environments where the number of times an infrastructure is accessed is taken into account.

In logical replication, this parameter also limits how often a failing replication apply worker or table synchronization worker will be respawned.

`recovery_min_apply_delay` (`integer`) [#](#GUC-RECOVERY-MIN-APPLY-DELAY)

By default, a standby server restores WAL records from the sending server as soon as possible. It may be useful to have a time-delayed copy of the data, offering opportunities to correct data loss errors. This parameter allows you to delay recovery by a specified amount of time. For example, if you set this parameter to `5min`, the standby will replay each transaction commit only when the system time on the standby is at least five minutes past the commit time reported by the primary. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as milliseconds. The default is zero, adding no delay.

It is possible that the replication delay between servers exceeds the value of this parameter, in which case no delay is added. Note that the delay is calculated between the WAL time stamp as written on primary and the current time on the standby. Delays in transfer because of network lag or cascading replication configurations may reduce the actual wait time significantly. If the system clocks on primary and standby are not synchronized, this may lead to recovery applying records earlier than expected; but that is not a major issue because useful settings of this parameter are much larger than typical time deviations between servers.

The delay occurs only on WAL records for transaction commits. Other records are replayed as quickly as possible, which is not a problem because MVCC visibility rules ensure their effects are not visible until the corresponding commit record is applied.

The delay occurs once the database in recovery has reached a consistent state, until the standby is promoted or triggered. After that the standby will end recovery without further waiting.

WAL records must be kept on the standby until they are ready to be applied. Therefore, longer delays will result in a greater accumulation of WAL files, increasing disk space requirements for the standby's `pg_wal` directory.

This parameter is intended for use with streaming replication deployments; however, if the parameter is specified it will be honored in all cases except crash recovery. `hot_standby_feedback` will be delayed by use of this feature which could lead to bloat on the primary; use both together with care.

### Warning

Synchronous replication is affected by this setting when `synchronous_commit` is set to `remote_apply`; every `COMMIT` will need to wait to be applied.

This parameter can only be set in the `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line.

`sync_replication_slots` (`boolean`) [#](#GUC-SYNC-REPLICATION-SLOTS)

It enables a physical standby to synchronize logical failover slots from the primary server so that logical subscribers can resume replication from the new primary server after failover.

It is disabled by default. This parameter can only be set in the `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line.
