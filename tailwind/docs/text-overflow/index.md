Utilities for controlling how the text of an element overflows.

Class

Styles

`truncate`

`overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;`

`text-ellipsis`

`text-overflow: ellipsis;`

`text-clip`

`text-overflow: clip;`

## [Examples](#examples)

### [Truncating text](#truncating-text)

Use the `truncate` utility to prevent text from wrapping and truncate overflowing text with an ellipsis (…) if needed:

The longest word in any of the major English language dictionaries is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis, a word that refers to a lung disease contracted from the inhalation of very fine silica particles, specifically from a volcano; medically, it is the same as silicosis.

```
<p class="truncate">The longest word in any of the major...</p>
```

### [Adding an ellipsis](#adding-an-ellipsis)

Use the `text-ellipsis` utility to truncate overflowing text with an ellipsis (…) if needed:

The longest word in any of the major English language dictionaries is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis, a word that refers to a lung disease contracted from the inhalation of very fine silica particles, specifically from a volcano; medically, it is the same as silicosis.

```
<p class="overflow-hidden text-ellipsis">The longest word in any of the major...</p>
```

### [Clipping text](#clipping-text)

Use the `text-clip` utility to truncate the text at the limit of the content area:

The longest word in any of the major English language dictionaries is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis, a word that refers to a lung disease contracted from the inhalation of very fine silica particles, specifically from a volcano; medically, it is the same as silicosis.

```
<p class="overflow-hidden text-clip">The longest word in any of the major...</p>
```

This is the default browser behavior.

### [Responsive design](#responsive-design)

Prefix a `text-overflow` utility with a breakpoint variant like `md:` to only apply the utility at medium screen sizes and above:

```
<p class="text-ellipsis md:text-clip ...">  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...</p>
```

Learn more about using variants in the [variants documentation](tailwind/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states/index.md).
