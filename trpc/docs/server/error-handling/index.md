Whenever an error occurs in a procedure, tRPC responds to the client with an object that includes an "error" property. This property contains all the information that you need to handle the error in the client.

Here's an example error response caused by a bad request input:

json

`{`

  `"id": null,`

  `"error": {`

    `"message": "\"password\" must be at least 4 characters",`

    `"code": -32600,`

    `"data": {`

      `"code": "BAD_REQUEST",`

      `"httpStatus": 400,`

      `"stack": "...",`

      `"path": "user.changepassword"`

    `}`

  `}`

`}`

## Stack traces in production[​](#stack-traces-in-production "Direct link to Stack traces in production")

By default, tRPC includes `error.data.stack` only when [`isDev`](../routers/index.md#initialize-trpc) is `true`. `initTRPC.create()` sets `isDev` to `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` by default. If you need deterministic behavior across runtimes, override `isDev` manually.

server.ts

ts

`import { initTRPC } from '@trpc/server';`

`const t = initTRPC.create({ isDev: false });`

If you need stricter control over which error fields are returned, use [error formatting](../error-formatting/index.md).

## Error codes[​](#error-codes "Direct link to Error codes")

tRPC defines a list of error codes that each represent a different type of error and response with a different HTTP code.

Code

Description

HTTP code

PARSE\_ERROR

Invalid JSON was received by the server, or an error occurred while parsing the request.

400

BAD\_REQUEST

The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error.

400

UNAUTHORIZED

The client request has not been completed because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the requested resource.

401

PAYMENT\_REQUIRED

The client request requires payment to access the requested resource.

402

FORBIDDEN

The client is not authorized to access the requested resource.

403

NOT\_FOUND

The server cannot find the requested resource.

404

METHOD\_NOT\_SUPPORTED

The server knows the request method, but the target resource doesn't support this method.

405

TIMEOUT

The server would like to shut down this unused connection.

408

CONFLICT

The request conflicts with the current state of the target resource.

409

PRECONDITION\_FAILED

Access to the target resource has been denied.

412

PAYLOAD\_TOO\_LARGE

Request entity is larger than limits defined by server.

413

UNSUPPORTED\_MEDIA\_TYPE

The server refuses to accept the request because the payload format is in an unsupported format.

415

UNPROCESSABLE\_CONTENT

The server understands the request method, and the request entity is correct, but the server was unable to process it.

422

PRECONDITION\_REQUIRED

[The server cannot process the request because a required precondition header (such as `If-Match`) is missing. When a precondition header does not match the server-side state, the response should be `412 Precondition Failed`.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/428)

428

TOO\_MANY\_REQUESTS

The rate limit has been exceeded or too many requests are being sent to the server.

429

CLIENT\_CLOSED\_REQUEST

The client closed the connection before the server finished responding.

499

INTERNAL\_SERVER\_ERROR

An unspecified error occurred.

500

NOT\_IMPLEMENTED

The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request.

501

BAD\_GATEWAY

The server received an invalid response from the upstream server.

502

SERVICE\_UNAVAILABLE

The server is not ready to handle the request.

503

GATEWAY\_TIMEOUT

The server did not get a response in time from the upstream server that it needed in order to complete the request.

504

tRPC exposes a helper function, `getHTTPStatusCodeFromError`, to help you extract the HTTP code from the error:

ts

`import { getHTTPStatusCodeFromError } from '@trpc/server/http';`

`// Example error you might get if your input validation fails`

`const error: TRPCError = {`

  `name: 'TRPCError',`

  `code: 'BAD_REQUEST',`

  `message: '"password" must be at least 4 characters',`

`};`

`if (error instanceof TRPCError) {`

  `const httpCode = getHTTPStatusCodeFromError(error);`

  `console.log(httpCode); // 400`

`}`

## Throwing errors[​](#throwing-errors "Direct link to Throwing errors")

tRPC provides an error subclass, `TRPCError`, which you can use to represent an error that occurred inside a procedure.

For example, throwing this error:

server.ts

ts

`import { initTRPC, TRPCError } from '@trpc/server';`

`const t = initTRPC.create();`

`const theError = new Error('something went wrong');`

`const appRouter = t.router({`

  `hello: t.procedure.query(() => {`

    `throw new TRPCError({`

      `code: 'INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR',`

      `message: 'An unexpected error occurred, please try again later.',`

      `// optional: pass the original error to retain stack trace`

      `cause: theError,`

    `});`

  `}),`

`});`

`// [...]`

Results in the following response:

json

`{`

  `"id": null,`

  `"error": {`

    `"message": "An unexpected error occurred, please try again later.",`

    `"code": -32603,`

    `"data": {`

      `"code": "INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR",`

      `"httpStatus": 500,`

      `"stack": "...",`

      `"path": "hello"`

    `}`

  `}`

`}`

## Handling errors[​](#handling-errors "Direct link to Handling errors")

All errors that occur in a procedure go through the `onError` method before being sent to the client. Here you can handle errors (To change errors see [error formatting](../error-formatting/index.md)).

server.ts

ts

`import { createHTTPServer } from '@trpc/server/adapters/standalone';`

`import { appRouter } from './router';`

`const server = createHTTPServer({`

  `router: appRouter,`

  `onError(opts) {`

    `const { error, type, path, input, ctx, req } = opts;`

    `console.error('Error:', error);`

    `if (error.code === 'INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR') {`

      `// send to bug reporting`

    `}`

  `},`

`});`

The `onError` parameter is an object that contains all information about the error and the context it occurs in:

ts

`interface OnErrorOpts {`

  `error: TRPCError;`

  `type: 'query' | 'mutation' | 'subscription' | 'unknown';`

  `path: string | undefined;`

  `input: unknown;`

  `ctx: unknown;`

  `req: Request;`

`}`
