The server-side helpers provides you with a set of helper functions that you can use to prefetch queries on the server. This is useful for SSG, but also for SSR if you opt not to use `ssr: true`.

Prefetching via the server-side helpers allows populating the query cache on the server, which means that these queries do not have to fetch on the client initially.

## There are 2 ways to use the server-side helpers.[​](#there-are-2-ways-to-use-the-server-side-helpers "Direct link to There are 2 ways to use the server-side helpers.")

### 1\. Internal router[​](#1-internal-router "Direct link to 1. Internal router")

This method is used when you have direct access to your tRPC router. e.g. when developing a monolithic Next.js application.

Using the helpers makes tRPC call your procedures directly on the server, without an HTTP request, similar to [server-side calls](https://trpc.io/docs/server/server-side-calls). That also means that you don't have the request and response at hand like you usually do. Make sure you're instantiating the server-side helpers with a context without `req` & `res`, which are typically filled via the context creation. We recommend the concept of ["inner" and "outer" context](https://trpc.io/docs/server/context) in that scenario.

ts

`import { createServerSideHelpers } from '@trpc/react-query/server';`

`import { createContext } from '~/server/context';`

`import superjson from 'superjson';`

`const helpers = createServerSideHelpers({`

  `router: appRouter,`

  `ctx: await createContext(),`

  `transformer: superjson, // optional - adds superjson serialization`

`});`

### 2\. External router[​](#2-external-router "Direct link to 2. External router")

This method is used when you don't have direct access to your tRPC router. e.g. when developing a Next.js application and a standalone API hosted separately.

ts

`import { createTRPCProxyClient } from '@trpc/client';`

`import { createServerSideHelpers } from '@trpc/react-query/server';`

`import superjson from 'superjson';`

`const proxyClient = createTRPCProxyClient<AppRouter>({`

  `links: [`

    `httpBatchLink({`

      `url: 'http://localhost:3000/api/trpc',`

    `}),`

  `],`

  `transformer: superjson,`

`});`

`const helpers = createServerSideHelpers({`

  `client: proxyClient,`

`});`

## Helpers usage[​](#helpers-usage "Direct link to Helpers usage")

The server-side helpers methods return an object much like the tRPC client, with all of your routers as keys. However, rather than `useQuery` and `useMutation`, you get `prefetch`, `fetch`, `prefetchInfinite`, and `fetchInfinite` functions.

The primary difference between `prefetch` and `fetch` is that `fetch` acts much like a normal function call, returning the result of the query, whereas `prefetch` does not return the result and never throws - if you need that behavior, use `fetch` instead. Instead, `prefetch` will add the query to the cache, which you then dehydrate and send to the client.

ts

`return {`

  `props: {`

    ``// very important - use `trpcState` as the key``

    `trpcState: helpers.dehydrate(),`

  `},`

`};`

The rule of thumb is `prefetch` for queries that you know you'll need on the client, and `fetch` for queries that you want to use the result of on the server.

The functions are all wrappers around react-query functions. Please check out [their docs](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/overview) to learn more about them in detail.

tsx

`import { createServerSideHelpers } from '@trpc/react-query/server';`

`import { GetServerSidePropsContext, InferGetServerSidePropsType } from 'next';`

`import { appRouter } from 'server/routers/_app';`

`import superjson from 'superjson';`

`import { trpc } from 'utils/trpc';`

`export async function getServerSideProps(`

  `context: GetServerSidePropsContext<{ id: string }>,`

`) {`

  `const helpers = createServerSideHelpers({`

    `router: appRouter,`

    `ctx: {},`

    `transformer: superjson,`

  `});`

  `const id = context.params?.id as string;`

  `/*`

   ``* Prefetching the `post.byId` query.``

   ``* `prefetch` does not return the result and never throws - if you need that behavior, use `fetch` instead.``

   `*/`

  `await helpers.post.byId.prefetch({ id });`

  `// Make sure to return { props: { trpcState: helpers.dehydrate() } }`

  `return {`

    `props: {`

      `trpcState: helpers.dehydrate(),`

      `id,`

    `},`

  `};`

`}`

`export default function PostViewPage(`

  `props: InferGetServerSidePropsType<typeof getServerSideProps>,`

`) {`

  `const { id } = props;`

  `const postQuery = trpc.post.byId.useQuery({ id });`

  `if (postQuery.status !== 'success') {`

    `// won't happen since the query has been prefetched`

    `return <>Loading...</>;`

  `}`

  `const { data } = postQuery;`

  `return (`

    `<>`

      `<h1>{data.title}</h1>`

      `<em>Created {data.createdAt.toLocaleDateString()}</em>`

      `<p>{data.text}</p>`

      `<h2>Raw data:</h2>`

      `<pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 4)}</pre>`

    `</>`

  `);`

`}`
