Links enable you to customize the flow of data between the tRPC Client and Server. A link should do only one thing, which can be either a self-contained modification to a tRPC operation (query, mutation, or subscription) or a side-effect based on the operation (such as logging).

You can compose links together into an array that you can provide to the tRPC client configuration via the `links` property, which represents a link chain. This means that the tRPC client will execute the links in the order they are added to the `links` array when doing a request and will execute them again in reverse when it's handling a response. Here's a visual representation of the link chain:

![tRPC Link Diagram](https://trpc.io/img/links-diagram.svg)tRPC Link Diagram. Based on [Apollo's](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/link/introduction/).

utils/trpc.ts

ts

`import { createTRPCClient, httpBatchLink, loggerLink } from '@trpc/client';`

`import type { AppRouter } from './server';`

`export const trpc = createTRPCClient<AppRouter>({`

  `links: [`

    `loggerLink(),`

    `httpBatchLink({`

      `url: 'http://localhost:3000',`

    `}),`

  `],`

`});`

## Creating a custom link[​](#creating-a-custom-link "Direct link to Creating a custom link")

A link is a function that follows the `TRPCLink` type. Each link is composed of three parts:

1.  The link returns a function that has no parameters. This is the setup phase where the link is initialized — it happens once per app and is useful for storing caches or other state.
2.  The function in step 1 returns another function that receives an object with two properties: `op` which is the `Operation` that is being executed by the client, and `next` which is the function we use to call the next link down the chain.
3.  The function in step 2 returns a final function that returns the `observable` function provided by `@trpc/server`. The `observable` accepts a function that receives an `observer` which helps our link notify the next link up the chain how they should handle the operation result. In this function, we can just return `next(op)` and leave it as is, or we can subscribe to `next`, which enables our link to handle the operation result.

### Example[​](#example "Direct link to Example")

utils/customLink.ts

tsx

`import { TRPCLink } from '@trpc/client';`

`import { observable } from '@trpc/server/observable';`

`import type { AppRouter } from './server';`

`export const customLink: TRPCLink<AppRouter> = () => {`

  `// here we just got initialized in the app - this happens once per app`

  `// useful for storing cache for instance`

  `return ({ next, op }) => {`

    `// this is when passing the result to the next link`

    `// each link needs to return an observable which propagates results`

    `return observable((observer) => {`

      `console.log('performing operation:', op);`

      `const unsubscribe = next(op).subscribe({`

        `next(value) {`

          `console.log('we received value', value);`

          `observer.next(value);`

        `},`

        `error(err) {`

          `console.log('we received error', err);`

          `observer.error(err);`

        `},`

        `complete() {`

          `observer.complete();`

        `},`

      `});`

      `return unsubscribe;`

    `});`

  `};`

`};`

### References[​](#references "Direct link to References")

If you need a more real reference for creating your custom link, you can check out some of the built-in links tRPC provides on [GitHub](https://github.com/trpc/trpc/tree/main/packages/client/src/links).

## The terminating link[​](#the-terminating-link "Direct link to The terminating link")

The **terminating link** is the last link in a link chain. Instead of calling the `next` function, the terminating link is responsible for sending your composed tRPC operation to the tRPC server and returning an `OperationResultEnvelope`.

The `links` array that you add to the tRPC client config should have at least one link, and that link should be a terminating link. If `links` don't have a terminating link at the end of them, the tRPC operation will not be sent to the tRPC server.

[`httpBatchLink`](trpc/docs/client/links/httpBatchLink/index.md) is the recommended terminating link by tRPC.

[`httpLink`](trpc/docs/client/links/httpLink/index.md), [`httpBatchStreamLink`](trpc/docs/client/links/httpBatchStreamLink/index.md), [`httpSubscriptionLink`](trpc/docs/client/links/httpSubscriptionLink/index.md), [`wsLink`](trpc/docs/client/links/wsLink/index.md), and [`localLink`](trpc/docs/client/links/localLink/index.md) are other examples of terminating links depending on your needs.

## Managing context[​](#managing-context "Direct link to Managing context")

As an operation moves along your link chain, it maintains a context that each link can read and modify. This allows links to pass metadata along the chain that other links use in their execution logic.

Obtain the current context object and modify it by accessing `op.context`.

You can set the context object's initial value for a particular operation by providing the context parameter to the `query` or `useQuery` hook (or `mutation`, `subscription`, etc.).

For an example use case, see [Disable batching for certain requests](trpc/docs/client/links/splitLink/index.md#disable-batching-for-certain-requests).
