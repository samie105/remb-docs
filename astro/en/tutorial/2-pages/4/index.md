# Style your About page

Now that you have an About page with content about you, it’s time to style it!

Get ready to…

*   Style items on a single page
*   Use CSS variables

## Style an individual page

[Section titled “Style an individual page”](#style-an-individual-page)

Using Astro’s own `<style></style>` tags, you can style items on your page. Adding **attributes** and **directives** to these tags gives you even more ways to style.

1.  Copy the following code and paste it into `src/pages/about.astro`:
    
    ```
    <html lang="en">  <head>    <meta charset="utf-8" />    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />    <title>{pageTitle}</title>    <style>      h1 {        color: purple;        font-size: 4rem;      }    </style>  </head>
    ```
    
    Check all three pages in your browser preview.
    
    *   Which color is the page title of:
        
        *   Your Home page?  black
        *   Your About page?  purple
        *   Your Blog page?  black
    *   The page with the biggest title text is?  Your About page
        
2.  Add the class name `skill` to the generated `<li>` elements on your About page, so you can style them. Your code should now look like this:
    
    ```
    <p>My skills are:</p><ul>  {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}</ul>
    ```
    
3.  Add the following code to your existing style tag:
    
    ```
    <style>  h1 {    color: purple;    font-size: 4rem;  }  .skill {    color: green;    font-weight: bold;  }</style>
    ```
    
4.  Visit your About page in your browser again, and verify, through visual inspection or dev tools, that each item in your list of skills is now green and bold.
    

## Use your first CSS variable

[Section titled “Use your first CSS variable”](#use-your-first-css-variable)

The Astro `<style>` tag can also reference any variables from your frontmatter script using the `define:vars={ {...} }` directive. You can **define variables within your code fence**, then **use them as CSS variables in your style tag**.

1.  Define a `skillColor` variable by adding it to the frontmatter script of `src/pages/about.astro` like this:
    
    ```
    ---const pageTitle = "About Me";
    const identity = {  firstName: "Sarah",  country: "Canada",  occupation: "Technical Writer",  hobbies: ["photography", "birdwatching", "baseball"],};
    const skills = ["HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript", "React", "Astro", "Writing Docs"];
    const happy = true;const finished = false;const goal = 3;
    const skillColor = "crimson";---
    ```
    
2.  Update your existing `<style>` tag below to first define, then use this `skillColor` variable inside double curly braces.
    
    ```
    <style define:vars={{skillColor}}>  h1 {    color: purple;    font-size: 4rem;  }  .skill {    color: green;    color: var(--skillColor);    font-weight: bold;  }</style>
    ```
    
3.  Check your About page in your browser preview. You should see that the skills are now crimson red, as set by the `skillColor` variable passed to the `define:vars` directive.
    

## Try it yourself - Define CSS variables

[Section titled “Try it yourself - Define CSS variables”](#try-it-yourself---define-css-variables)

1.  Update the `<style>` tag on your About page so that it matches the one below.
    
    ```
    <style define:vars={{skillColor, fontWeight, textCase}}>  h1 {    color: purple;    font-size: 4rem;  }  .skill {    color: var(--skillColor);    font-weight: var(--fontWeight);    text-transform: var(--textCase);  }</style>
    ```
    
2.  Add any missing variable definitions in your frontmatter script so that your new `<style>` tag successfully applies these styles to your list of skills:
    
    *   The text color is crimson red
    *   The text is bold
    *   The list items are in all-caps (all uppercase letters)

✅ Show me the code! ✅

```
---const pageTitle = "About Me";
const identity = {  firstName: "Sarah",  country: "Canada",  occupation: "Technical Writer",  hobbies: ["photography", "birdwatching", "baseball"],};
const skills = ["HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript", "React", "Astro", "Writing Docs"];
const happy = true;const finished = false;const goal = 3;
const skillColor = "crimson";const fontWeight = "bold";const textCase = "uppercase";---
```
