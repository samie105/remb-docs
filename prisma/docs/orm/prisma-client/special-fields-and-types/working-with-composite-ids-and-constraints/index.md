Special Fields and Types

How to read, write, and filter by compound IDs and unique constraints

Composite IDs and compound unique constraints can be defined in your Prisma schema using the [`@@id`](../../../reference/prisma-schema-reference/index.md) and [`@@unique`](../../../reference/prisma-schema-reference/index.md) attributes.

A composite ID or compound unique constraint uses the combined values of two fields as a primary key or identifier in your database table. In the following example, the `postId` field and `userId` field are used as a composite ID for a `Like` table:

```
model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  name  String
  post  Post[]
  likes Like[]
}

model Post {
  id      Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  content String
  User    User?  @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId  Int?
  likes   Like[]
}

model Like {
  postId Int
  userId Int
  User   User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  Post   Post @relation(fields: [postId], references: [id])

  @@id([postId, userId]) 
}
```

Querying for records from the `Like` table (e.g. using `prisma.like.findMany()`) would return objects that look as follows:

```
{
  "postId": 1,
  "userId": 1
}
```

Although there are only two fields in the response, those two fields make up a compound ID named `postId_userId`.

You can also create a named compound ID or compound unique constraint by using the `@@id` or `@@unique` attributes' `name` field. For example:

```
model Like {
  postId Int
  userId Int
  User   User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  Post   Post @relation(fields: [postId], references: [id])

  @@id(name: "likeId", [postId, userId]) 
}
```

Compound IDs and compound unique constraints can be used when working with _unique_ data.

Below is a list of Prisma Client functions that accept a compound ID or compound unique constraint in the `where` filter of the query:

-   `findUnique()`
-   `findUniqueOrThrow`
-   `delete`
-   `update`
-   `upsert`

A composite ID and a composite unique constraint is also usable when creating relational data with `connect` and `connectOrCreate`.

Although your query results will not display a compound ID or unique constraint as a field, you can use these compound values to filter your queries for unique records:

```
const like = await prisma.like.findUnique({
  where: {
    likeId: {
      userId: 1,
      postId: 1,
    },
  },
});
```

A compound ID or compound unique constraint may be used in the `where` filter of a `delete` query:

```
const like = await prisma.like.delete({
  where: {
    likeId: {
      userId: 1,
      postId: 1,
    },
  },
});
```

A compound ID or compound unique constraint may be used in the `where` filter of an `update` query:

```
const like = await prisma.like.update({
  where: {
    likeId: {
      userId: 1,
      postId: 1,
    },
  },
  data: {
    postId: 2,
  },
});
```

They may also be used in the `where` filter of an `upsert` query:

```
await prisma.like.upsert({
  where: {
    likeId: {
      userId: 1,
      postId: 1,
    },
  },
  update: {
    userId: 2,
  },
  create: {
    userId: 2,
    postId: 1,
  },
});
```

Compound IDs and compound unique constraint can also be used in the `connect` and `connectOrCreate` keys used when connecting records to create a relationship.

For example, consider this query:

```
await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    name: "Alice",
    likes: {
      connect: {
        likeId: {
          postId: 1,
          userId: 2,
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

The `likeId` compound ID is used as the identifier in the `connect` object that is used to locate the `Like` table's record that will be linked to the new user: `"Alice"`.

Similarly, the `likeId` can be used in `connectOrCreate`'s `where` filter to attempt to locate an existing record in the `Like` table:

```
await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    name: "Alice",
    likes: {
      connectOrCreate: {
        create: {
          postId: 1,
        },
        where: {
          likeId: {
            postId: 1,
            userId: 1,
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```
