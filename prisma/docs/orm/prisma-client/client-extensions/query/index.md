You can use the `query` [Prisma Client extensions](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/client-extensions) component type to hook into the query life-cycle and modify an incoming query or its result.

You can use Prisma Client extensions `query` component to create independent clients with customized behavior. You can bind one client to a specific filter or user, and another client to another filter or user. For example, you might do this to get [user isolation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/client-extensions#extended-clients) in a row-level security (RLS) extension. The `query` extension component provides end-to-end type safety for all your custom queries.

Use the `$extends` [client-level method](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/reference/prisma-client-reference#client-methods) to create an [extended client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/client-extensions#about-prisma-client-extensions). An extended client is a variant of the standard Prisma Client that is wrapped by one or more extensions.

Use the `query` extension component to modify queries. You can modify a custom query in the following:

-   [A specific operation in a specific model](#modify-a-specific-operation-in-a-specific-model)
-   [A specific operation in all models of your schema](#modify-a-specific-operation-in-all-models-of-your-schema)
-   [All Prisma Client operations](#modify-all-prisma-client-operations)
-   [All operations in a specific model](#modify-all-operations-in-a-specific-model)
-   [All operations in all models of your schema](#modify-all-operations-in-all-models-of-your-schema)
-   [A specific top-level raw query operation](#modify-a-top-level-raw-query-operation)

To create a custom query, use the following structure:

```
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends({
  name?: 'name',
  query?: {
    user: { ... } // in this case, we add a query to the `user` model
  },
});
```

The properties are as follows:

-   `name`: (optional) specifies a name for the extension that appears in error logs.
-   `query`: defines a custom query.

### [Modify a specific operation in a specific model](#modify-a-specific-operation-in-a-specific-model)

The `query` object can contain functions that map to the names of the [Prisma Client operations](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/reference/prisma-client-reference#model-queries), such as `findUnique()`, `findFirst`, `findMany`, `count`, and `create`. The following example modifies `user.findMany` to a use a customized query that finds only users who are older than 18 years:

```
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends({
  query: {
    user: {
      async findMany({ model, operation, args, query }) {
        // take incoming `where` and set `age`
        args.where = { ...args.where, age: { gt: 18 } };

        return query(args);
      },
    },
  },
});

await prisma.user.findMany(); // returns users whose age is greater than 18
```

In the above example, a call to `prisma.user.findMany` triggers `query.user.findMany`. Each callback receives a type-safe `{ model, operation, args, query }` object that describes the query. This object has the following properties:

-   `model`: the name of the containing model for the query that we want to extend.
    
    In the above example, the `model` is a string of type `"User"`.
    
-   `operation`: the name of the operation being extended and executed.
    
    In the above example, the `operation` is a string of type `"findMany"`.
    
-   `args`: the specific query input information to be extended.
    
    This is a type-safe object that you can mutate before the query happens. You can mutate any of the properties in `args`. Exception: you cannot mutate `include` or `select` because that would change the expected output type and break type safety.
    
-   `query`: a promise for the result of the query.
    
    -   You can use `await` and then mutate the result of this promise, because its value is type-safe. TypeScript catches any unsafe mutations on the object.

### [Modify a specific operation in all models of your schema](#modify-a-specific-operation-in-all-models-of-your-schema)

To extend the queries in all the models of your schema, use `$allModels` instead of a specific model name. For example:

```
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends({
  query: {
    $allModels: {
      async findMany({ model, operation, args, query }) {
        // set `take` and fill with the rest of `args`
        args = { ...args, take: 100 };

        return query(args);
      },
    },
  },
});
```

### [Modify all operations in a specific model](#modify-all-operations-in-a-specific-model)

Use `$allOperations` to extend all operations in a specific model.

For example, the following code applies a custom query to all operations on the `user` model:

```
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends({
  query: {
    user: {
      $allOperations({ model, operation, args, query }) {
        /* your custom logic here */
        return query(args);
      },
    },
  },
});
```

### [Modify all Prisma Client operations](#modify-all-prisma-client-operations)

Use the `$allOperations` method to modify all query methods present in Prisma Client. The `$allOperations` can be used on both model operations and raw queries.

You can modify all methods as follows:

```
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends({
  query: {
    $allOperations({ model, operation, args, query }) {
      /* your custom logic for modifying all Prisma Client operations here */
      return query(args);
    },
  },
});
```

In the event a [raw query](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/using-raw-sql/raw-queries) is invoked, the `model` argument passed to the callback will be `undefined`.

For example, you can use the `$allOperations` method to log queries as follows:

```
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends({
  query: {
    async $allOperations({ operation, model, args, query }) {
      const start = performance.now();
      const result = await query(args);
      const end = performance.now();
      const time = end - start;
      console.log(
        util.inspect(
          { model, operation, args, time },
          { showHidden: false, depth: null, colors: true },
        ),
      );
      return result;
    },
  },
});
```

### [Modify all operations in all models of your schema](#modify-all-operations-in-all-models-of-your-schema)

Use `$allModels` and `$allOperations` to extend all operations in all models of your schema.

To apply a custom query to all operations on all models of your schema:

```
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends({
  query: {
    $allModels: {
      $allOperations({ model, operation, args, query }) {
        /* your custom logic for modifying all operations on all models here */
        return query(args);
      },
    },
  },
});
```

### [Modify a top-level raw query operation](#modify-a-top-level-raw-query-operation)

To apply custom behavior to a specific top-level raw query operation, use the name of a top-level raw query function instead of a model name:

### [Mutate the result of a query](#mutate-the-result-of-a-query)

You can use `await` and then mutate the result of the `query` promise.

```
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends({
  query: {
    user: {
      async findFirst({ model, operation, args, query }) {
        const user = await query(args);

        if (user.password !== undefined) {
          user.password = "******";
        }

        return user;
      },
    },
  },
});
```

You can wrap your extended queries into a [batch transaction](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/queries/transactions). For example, you can use this to enact row-level security (RLS).

The following example extends `findFirst` so that it runs in a batch transaction.

```
const transactionExtension = Prisma.defineExtension((prisma) =>
  prisma.$extends({
    query: {
      user: {
        // Get the input `args` and a callback to `query`
        async findFirst({ args, query, operation }) {
          const [result] = await prisma.$transaction([query(args)]); // wrap the query in a batch transaction, and destructure the result to return an array
          return result; // return the first result found in the array
        },
      },
    },
  }),
);
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(transactionExtension);
```
