Bun supports `.jsx` and `.tsx` files out of the box. React works with Bun. Create a new React app with `bun init --react`. This gives you a template with a React app and an API server together in one full-stack app.

terminal

```
# Create a new React app
bun init --react

# Run the app in development mode
bun dev

# Build as a static site for production
bun run build

# Run the server in production
bun start
```

* * *

### Hot Reloading

Run `bun dev` to start the app in development mode. This will start the API server and the React app with hot reloading.

### Full-Stack App

Run `bun start` to start the API server and frontend together in one process.

### Static Site

Run `bun run build` to build the app as a static site. This will create a `dist` directory with the built app and all the assets.
